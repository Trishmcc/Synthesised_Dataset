# Programming-for-Data-Analysis

This repository contains information about simulating heart disease data. Variables were investigated and their likely distributions and their relationships with eachother. This is for a module named Programming for Data Analysis (2021) 

The data is synthesised and modelled using Python. numpy.random package was used for this purpose.

# How to Install numpy.random package
You need Python to run numpy. Numpy can be installed using Python package manager. (pip command)
    pip install numpy
Numpy random package is already included in the numpy package.
